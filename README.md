# Predicting Cosmetic Sales Growth with AI Adoption

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores how AI adoption (such as recommendation engines, personalized marketing, and inventory optimization) impacts sales growth in the cosmetics industry.  
Using a real-world dataset, the project performs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), builds a basic predictive model, and delivers business insights via a dashboard.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and prepare cosmetic sales data
- Perform EDA to visualize current and historical sales trends
- Build a predictive model to estimate future sales trends
- Deliver key insights through a Power BI or Tableau dashboard
- Organize project workflow using a Kanban board (Trello)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Power BI** or **Tableau**
- **Trello** (for project management)
- **GitHub** (for version control and portfolio presentation)
