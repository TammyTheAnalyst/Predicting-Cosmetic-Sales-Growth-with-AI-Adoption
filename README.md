# 💄📈 AI-Powered Sales Forecasting in the Cosmetics Industry

---


## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores how AI adoption (such as recommendation engines, personalized marketing, and inventory optimization) may influence sales growth in the cosmetics industry.

Using a real-world dataset, the project includes:
***data cleaning***, ***exploratory data analysis (EDA)***, ***feature engineering***, and a ***predictive model built with linear regression***. 

The model evaluates how sales trends shift in relation to AI adoption, with results visualized using Python-based charts and documented clearly throughout the GitHub repository.

This project explores how AI adoption (such as recommendation engines, personalized marketing, and inventory optimization) may influence sales growth in the cosmetics industry.

Using a real-world dataset, the project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering,
and a predictive model built with linear regression. The model evaluates how sales trends shift in relation to AI adoption,
with results visualized using Python-based charts and documented clearly throughout the GitHub repository.

## 📈 Key Insights & Findings

- 📊 **Sales are heavily skewed**, with most products generating low to moderate revenue, while a few SKUs dominate total sales volume.
- 📦 **Outlier detection** revealed extreme sales spikes for certain SKUs — useful for identifying promotional events or seasonal demand.
- 🔥 **AI adoption appeared to align with increased sales** for several high-performing SKUs, based on our simulated adoption timeline.
- 📉 **Correlations** between unit price, quantity sold, and net sales were strong, validating them as meaningful predictors in modeling.
- 🤖 **Linear regression modeling achieved high performance**, with an R² of 0.996 — indicating that sales can be accurately predicted based on engineered features.
- 📂 **This project demonstrates an end-to-end data science pipeline**: data loading, cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, modeling, and visualization.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and prepare cosmetic sales data
- Perform EDA to visualize current and historical sales trends
- Build a predictive model to estimate future sales trends
- Deliver key insights through a Power BI or Tableau dashboard
- Organize project workflow using a Kanban board (Trello)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**:  
  - `pandas` – data cleaning, feature creation  
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – data visualization (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, scatterplots)  
  - `scikit-learn` – train/test split, linear regression model, evaluation (RMSE & R²)

- **GitHub**:  
  - Organized repo with `/data`, `/notebooks`, `/images`, and `/models` folders  
  - Commit history documents the modeling process  
  - Markdown for README, visuals, and file tracking

- **Trello**:  
  - Used a Kanban board to manage progress  
  - Labeled and tracked tasks across EDA, modeling, and presentation

- **Jupyter Notebook**:  
  - Primary development environment for all Python work
