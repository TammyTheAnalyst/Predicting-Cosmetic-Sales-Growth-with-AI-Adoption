# Predicting Cosmetic Sales Growth with AI Adoption

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores how AI adoption (such as recommendation engines, personalized marketing, and inventory optimization) may influence sales growth in the cosmetics industry.

Using a real-world dataset, the project includes **data cleaning***, ***exploratory data analysis (EDA)***, ***feature engineering***, and a ***predictive model built with linear regression***. 
The model evaluates how sales trends shift in relation to AI adoption, with results visualized using Python-based charts and documented clearly throughout the GitHub repository.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and prepare cosmetic sales data
- Perform EDA to visualize current and historical sales trends
- Build a predictive model to estimate future sales trends
- Deliver key insights through a Power BI or Tableau dashboard
- Organize project workflow using a Kanban board (Trello)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**:  
  - `pandas` – data cleaning, feature creation  
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – data visualization (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, scatterplots)  
  - `scikit-learn` – train/test split, linear regression model, evaluation (RMSE & R²)

- **GitHub**:  
  - Organized repo with `/data`, `/notebooks`, `/images`, and `/models` folders  
  - Commit history documents the modeling process  
  - Markdown for README, visuals, and file tracking

- **Trello**:  
  - Used a Kanban board to manage progress  
  - Labeled and tracked tasks across EDA, modeling, and presentation

- **Jupyter Notebook**:  
  - Primary development environment for all Python work
